# programmable-keyboard
Repo to hold information about how I've set up my keyboard

## My common use cases
- Work in Google Docs a lot
- Program in Pycharm
- Common interfaces:
  - MacOS w/ programmable keyboard (main use case)
  - MacOS w/ laptop keyboard (when in meetings or traveling)
  - Windows w/ programmable keyboard (when on personal computer)

## Guiding Principles

### Movement
- Minimize movement off of the homerow
  - arrow keys under right hand homerow
- Reduce awkward stretching and combos
  - backspace moved to be underneath right thumb
  - layers used w/ Hyper key to make shortcuts for everything

### Ease of use
- Should be able to maintain a decent productivity
   - gradually introduce new keys and shortcuts rather than all at once
   - utilize per-key coloration to remind you as you're learning a new set of shortcuts/layers
   - if moving a key (like backspace to the thumb), then disable the default key to force yourself to learn faster
   - NOT switching to another layout like Dvorak or Colemak

### Transferability between my different interfaces
- vim key bindings for arrow keys are transferrable to vim
- karabiner elements used on mac for reprogrammability when only using keyboard on laptop
- nearly identical, but different layers tuned for mac and windows to have the same shortcuts available in the same locations across both OSes
- Dygma raise keyboard still uses standard staggered layout rather than ortholinear or columnar which allows me to easily switch to my laptop keyboard

## My setup

### Keyboard
- Dygma Raise

### Supplementary software configurations
#### Karabiner elements
- CAPS + hjkl for vim bindings
- command + c,x,v -> ctrl + c,x,v (windows shortcuts on mac
#### alt-tab software on MacOS

#### Pycharm
- remapping of hotkeys to hyperkey + *
- vim bindings plugin

### My Keyboard layers
